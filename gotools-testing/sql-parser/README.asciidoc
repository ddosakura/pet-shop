= sql-parser

sql-parser is parser substantially copy-and-paste from the book <flex & biosn>

 - generates Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) of SQL statements
 - integrates with GO's yacc and nex instead of Flex & BISON

I wrote this code to get acquainted with GO and SQL for further develop purpose. This is a subset of SQL. The ultimate definitions for SQL are the standards documents published by ANSI and
ISO including ISO/IEC 9075-2:2003, which defines SQL, and a variety of related documents
that define the way to embed SQL in other programming languages and in XML.
